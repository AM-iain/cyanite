    <h3>Scalable</h3>
    <p>By relying on <a href="http://cassandra.apache.org">Apache Cassandra</a>, cyanite makes scaling your
      metric infrastructure a breeze. No more shuffling whisper data around, just add nodes to your cluster!
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="col-md-3 col-sm-6">
    <h3>Fast</h3>
    <p>
      The underlying model in cyanite is optimized for very fast writes, and a constant write cost as you
      scale the cluster up. While this is mostly thanks to <a href="http://cassandra.apache.org">Apache Cassandra</a>,
      cyanite architecture which leverages a fast async event driven network library ensures it doesn't become a bottleneck

    <h3>Compatible</h3>
    <p>
      Fell in love with graphite-web's UI or maybe you're more of a grafana person ?<br/>
      Either way, cyanite gets you up and running quickly, thanks to its compatibility with graphite and graphite-api.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="col-md-3 col-sm-6">
    <h3>Simple</h3>
    <p>
      Installing and scaling cyanite is 100% worry-free. Relying on a simple YAML configuration file, cyanite will discover and
      keep track of its cassandra storage cluster as well as maintain a search index of metric names.
